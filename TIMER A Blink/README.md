For this assignment, a program had to be created that would blink two LEDs at different frequencies using interrupts that come from TimerA. In order to do this, two timers were set up to count to different values and an interrupt that would occur when each timer finished counting would have to be enabled. This interrupt would just toggle the LED on or off when the interrupt occurs. The only difference between the FR and G2 boards was again, the pin outs for each of the LEDs.
