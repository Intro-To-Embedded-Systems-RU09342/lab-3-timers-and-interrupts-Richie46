For this assignment, a timer would have to be used to blink an LED at a constant rate. In addition to this, the rate that the LED would blink would have to change based on how long a button is held down. in order to do this, several interrupts would have to be implemented. The first would blink the LED based on the constant rate of the first timer. The next would begin a counter and stop it when the button is let go of. Finally, the last interrupt would change the value that the first timer counts up to to the new amount. The differences between the FR and G2 boards were only the different pin numbers for the LEDs and buttons.
