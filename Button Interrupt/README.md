For this assignment, a program must be created that would allow an LED to blink continuously until a button would be pushed. Once it was pushed the blinking would stop and if it was pressed again the blinking would continue. In order to do this an interrupt must be used when the button was pressed. This code is very similar to the button blink from lab 2, with the exception of the interrupt itself. The interrupt would just change a volatile variable between 1 and 0 to activate and deactivate the blinking. The differences between the FR and G2 boards was just the different pin numbers for the buttons and LEDs.
